I need to have chapter 1,2,3 examples (including newsfeed example from chapter one)




Enhancement for the means of integrating the graphQL read from our database directly to the React.js client interface (vs only making it available from the developers console.)

Files involved: 
src/client/index.js
src/client/App.js
src/client/Feed.js
